After getting my VPS shut down for a second time by Digital Ocean (which apparently was issuing DOS network packets – no further explanation from DO), I decided to give Linode another whirl.

And here we are.

Running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and it’s a smooth as butta.

Software for now:

- nginx 1.10
- PHP 7.0.8
- MySQL 5.7.15

Will also probably get Node v6 running up there soon too.
