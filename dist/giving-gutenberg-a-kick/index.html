Gutenberg has already been merged into core, so it will be interesting to see how things go post-5.0. I wanted to see how it ‘felt’ to write a post with Gutenberg, so here goes!</p>
<h2 id="weird-stuff">Weird stuff</h2>
<p>The first thing I find weird about the writing experience with Gutenberg is that removing a block is counter-intuitive. Hitting backspace and having to delete reams of text is a bit funny. I would have thought that there would be a garbage can or something to remove a block.</p>
<p>(upon further investigation it appears there is a garbage can hidden under the more info dots ¯_(ツ)_/¯)</p>
<p>It’s also a bit weird personally _not_ writing in markdown mode, but that’s not really an issue with GB in particular.</p>
<p>I’m also not really sold on the concept of blocks, but I’m old and crusty at this point. I’m also a programmer, so I like text blobs!</p>
<p>I also think it’s weird that you can’t select text like you would in an editor. No way to select text from a bunch of blocks at once.</p>
<h2 id="good-stuff">Good stuff</h2>
<p>I think once people get used to the new editor it’ll be amazing for freelancers and agencies. It’s a tonne more feature-ful than the old editor. Especially for your average content editor. No need for crazy HTML in the post content to get a custom layout. No need for a bloated page builder either.</p>
<p>I think it’s also great the WP is pushing forward with a modern JS approach. That’s where things are going and having GB around in core will force WP devs to pick up things like ESNext and React. So I think that will drag us all forward. ?</p>
<h2 id="ps">P.S</h2>
<p>I also wrote this post in dev and used WP Migrate DB Pro to deploy it live. Worked well!</p> <hr> </article>  </main> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <hr> <p> <span class="muted"> <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=ecto-1&i=1367798">
