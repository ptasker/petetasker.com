While I agree that new tooling can sometimes be a pain to learn, since when did being a web developer/programmer/rockstar <em>not</em> require learning new things? I mean, learning the CLI is one thing, but it’s not suuuuper difficult and is definitely a skill that will serve you well in your career. On top of that, front-end build tooling has been around for a while, first with Grunt and then Gulp. Does Webpack make things that much more difficult?</p>
<p>The argument I’m making is partially around React and how Webpack (or similar) is required. To me, this doesn’t seem like a problem, as many languages <em>require</em> compilation during a build step. I see the build step and associated tooling a good thing, as it allows for more streamlined and complex programming concepts to be brought into front-end development.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about learning something like the Webpack build process, <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">Create React App</a> has got all the setup jank covered. In Vue, there’s <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli">vue-cli</a> which similarly gets you set up. In both cases all it takes to get up and running is <code>npm install</code> then <code>npm start</code>. That’s not too bad!</p>
<p>I guess what I’m saying, if all this ‘new’ stuff bothers you as a developer, it might be time to 1.) upgrade your skills, or 2.) do something else. Things aren’t slowing down any time soon in the front-end landscape, better get on the wagon or jump off!</p> <hr> </article>  </main> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <hr> <p> <span class="muted"> <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=ecto-1&i=1367798">
